## Introduction
Years ago, the United States was ravaged by war.
Wanting to form an everlasting peace, the government sent out men to investigate the causes.
They found that love was by far the most prominent cause of war.
Love became known as amor deliria nervosa.
Love caused desire. Desire ruined the people.
For the protection of the people, the government closed all borders.
For the protection of the people, the citizens were to move into protected cities.
For the protection of the people, the government worked on a cure.
Over years of experimentation, the government found a solution.
The cure was for those over the age of 18.
Getting the cure at a younger age would cause unwanted side-effects.
The cure rid the patient of all desire for love.
For without love, there is no desire.
Without desire, you are truly happy.
Without desire, you are at peace.
And the government wants you to be happy.
And the government wants you to be at peace.
