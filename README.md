# *Delirium - The Game*
A student created a game for a student project assigned by the student's teacher because teachers assign projects. Shocking, I know.

## About
Welcome to *Delirium - The Game*. This is a text-based game based off of the story *Delirium* by Lauren Oliver.  
The story is set in a dystopic version of America, where love is considered a disease  and all citizens take a “procedure” at the age of 18 to be “cured” from it. Liberties such as travel are restricted or prohibited. Things we take for granted such as electricity and the intranet (likely parody of internet) are limited and hard to come by, except for the rich. Those that resist are shunned from society.  
Soon to be 18, Lena Haloway begins the story believing this, and is quite excited at the prospect of being “cured” from the disease. Her mother was ravaged by it and supposedly took her own life because of it. Her friend Hana starts acting suspicious however, and seems to not believe in the “cure” anymore.  
Lena then unexpectedly meets a boy named Alex and starts hanging out with him. It gets to the point where she is unable to go the day without seeing him, a symptom of the love disease.  
However, Lena’s date to be “cured” is fast approaching, and she is running out of time to continue seeing him. After the “cure”, they likely would never have the same moments anymore. Lena needs to make a decision about what she wants to do which will determine the rest of her life.

## The Game
This game is set in the dystopic society. *You* are the main character, and your date for the cure is fast approaching. But first, you must pass evaluations.  
As each turn goes by, random events may happen which can alter your life forever. You may be granted certain choices which again will change your life.

Will you escape to the Wilds? Will you be locked up in the Crypts? Will you be cured?

## Mirroring Information
This is still a school project, and school projects have criteria. This section explains how the project mirrors the important theme from *Delirium*.

### Themes
Throughout the story of *Delirium*, Lena Haloway is constantly bombarded by misinformation. This is the main theme of the story, with smaller themes that additionally build towards this main theme.  
*Delirium - The Game* aims to target this theme by subtly sending the player misinformation. It's the player's job to determine the truths and lies the game provides.  
The goal is to make it so the player does not know if the information they were presented with was genuinely real or not. Only once they near the end, should they slowly realize that not all was what it seemed.
